OpenBSM 1.0

  Introduction

OpenBSM provides an open source implementation of Sun's BSM Audit API. 
Originally created under contract to Apple Computer by McAfee Research, 
this implementation is now maintained by volunteers and the generous 
contribution of several organizations.  Coupled with a kernel audit 
implementation, OpenBSM can be used to maintain system audit streams, and 
is a foundation for an Audit-enabled system.

  Contents

OpenBSM consists of several directories:

    bin/           Audit-related command line tools
    bsm/           System include files for BSM
    etc/           Sample /etc/security configuration files
    libbsm/        Implementation of BSM library interfaces and man pages
    man/           System call and configuration file man pages

OpenBSM currently builds on FreeBSD and Darwin.  With Makefile adjustment
and minor tweaks, it should build without problems on a broad range of
POSIX-like systems.
