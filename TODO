- Teach praudit how to general XML format BSM streams.
- Teach libbsm about any additional 64-bit token types that are present
  in more recent Solaris versions.
- Build a regression test suite for libbsm that generates each token
  type and then compares the results with known good data.  Make sure to
  test that things work properly with respect to endianness of the local
  platform.
